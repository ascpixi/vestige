## üåç Building for web
In order to build the project, use `npm run build`. The resulting web app will be placed in the `dist` directory. You can also use `npm run dev` in order to create a development build that you can access via `localhost`.

## üíª Building for desktop
Vestige uses Tauri in order to run as a standalone desktop app. Use `npx tauri build` in order to build the app alongside its installers. Similarly to the web build, you can also use `npx tauri dev` to create a development build.
